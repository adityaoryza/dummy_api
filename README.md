# Echo API

A simple Flask-based API that echoes back any JSON payload sent to it.

## Description

This project implements a basic API using Flask that accepts POST requests with JSON payloads and returns the same payload as a response. It's useful for testing and debugging purposes, such as:

- Testing a client or library against a dummy API
- Debugging a client or service that sends requests to an API
- Testing a service that sends requests to another service

## Getting Started
